Click on the *ferromagnetic* structure and download the .xyz file. Since we will need to do LDA calculations later on, we start by relaxing the structure with the LDA functional. We will be interested in the anti-ferromagnetic state later, but perform the relaxation in the ferromagnetic state, which has a smaller unit cell. Fill in the missing pieces and run the cell below. V has the electronic configuration [Ar]3d$^3$4s$^2$, which can be used to guess the initial magnetic moments. The calculation takes about 17 minutes.\n"

This is because spinors transform in a non-trivial way and the spin-orbit coupling can be obtained from the irreducible $k$-points without transforming the wavefunctions at symmetry related $k$-points. Evaluate the magnetic anisotropy in the cell below in a manner similar to the case of CrI$_3$. Is the easy-axis in plane or out of plane?

The calculation of $J$ requires two spin configurations and we could use the ferromagnetic calculation in the simple unit cell obtained at the top of the notebook as one of them.
